/simpledb/hash/ExtensibleHashIndex.java

We created a globaltable that stores information about all of the buckets. This includes each bucket's file location
(essentially a pointer) and each buckets local depth. For testing purposes the size of each bucket is 5 elements.

Whenever an insert is done, it checks if the localdepth should be increased by checking the current number of items in
the bucket. It then increases the localdepth if necessary. It checks the global depth and increases if necessary as well.

The ExtensibleHashIndex was tested using studentClient/simpledb/CreateTestTables.java. This created several test tables
that use various indexes. The program outputs the buckets and notes when it is increasing the local and global depth.
It was confirmed that these were increased when the buckets filled.
